 # Intro to pitchï¼š
 **Pitch** is a perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering on a frequency-related scale, or more commonly, pitch is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies.
 
 We use seven letters '**C**', '**D**', '**E**', '**F**', '**G**', '**A**', '**B**' to represent seven tones which have different pitches. In a more familiar way, they are known as their **Syllable names** **"Do Re Mi Fa So La Si"**.
 # Welcome to the game!
 Sing it loudly on **PitchBlock** â€” a game for your singing voice!
 
 Play the game by singing! Different blocks represent different pitches will fall from the ceiling. When they hit the bottom, sing loudly in pitches written on the blocks. During the game, seven unfixable blocks reveal your current pitch in a concrete way, so you can adjust your voice directly and fastly.
 
 With the help of PitchBlock, you can become a better singer in a fun wayâ€”just to get your pitch right.
